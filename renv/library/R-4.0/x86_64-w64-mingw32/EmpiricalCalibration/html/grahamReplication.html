<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Relative risks from an adjusted new-user cohort design
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
data(grahamReplication)
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 126 rows and 4 variables: </p>
 <dl>
<dt>outcomeName</dt><dd><p>Name of the outcome</p>
</dd>
<dt>trueLogRr</dt><dd><p>The log of the true effect size. Only provided for negative and positive controls, 
is NA for the outcome of interest (GI bleeding).</p>
</dd> <dt>logRr</dt><dd><p>The log of the incidence rate ratio</p>
</dd> <dt>seLogRr</dt><dd>
<p>The standard error of the log of the incidence rate ratio</p>
</dd> </dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the incidence rate ratios (and standard errors) produced using a new-user 
cohort design that compares new-users of dabigatran to new-users of warfarin for the outcome of 
GI hemorrhage. The dataset includes estimates both for the outcome of interest as well as negative 
and positive control outcomes. Subject are required to have 183 days of continuous observation 
prior to initiating treatment, be at least 65 years old at index date, and are required to have 
no prior exposure to warfarin or dabigatran (or any other novel anticoagulant). Furthermore, 
subjects are required to use the treatment for the indication of atrial fibrillation or atrial 
flutter, which is enforced by requiring a prior diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or flutter, 
and no prior diagnosis of other indications. Propensity scores are generated by fitting a model 
for predicting treatment assignment based on baseline patient characteristics, and are used to 
perform one-on-one matching. Hazard ratios are estimated through a Cox regression on the matched 
population. Time-at-risk is defined as starting on the day after initiating treatment and stopping 
when treatment is stopped, when the outcome occurs, or observation time ends, whichever comes first. 
The original study (Graham et al 2016) uses the Medicare database. For our replication, we use the 
Truven Medicare Supplementary Beneficiaries database. We analyze 15,796 dabigatran-exposed and 15,796 
warfarin-exposed subjects. For more information on this set see Schuemie et al (2017).
