</dd>
<dt>groundTruth</dt><dd><p>Whether the drug is a positive (1) or negative (0) control</p>

ratio</p>
</dd> </dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the incidence rate ratios (and standard errors) produced using a
Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) design. The outcome is upper GI bleeding, the drug of interest
(groundTruth = 1) is sertraline. Also included are 45 negative control drugs, for which we believe
there to be no causal relation with upper GI bleeding. We used a database of medical records from
general practices in the USA, the General Electric (GE) Centricity database, which contains data on
11.2 million subjects. We restricted on study period (start of 1990 through November 2003), age
requirements (18 years or older), available time prior to event (180 days), and risk definition
window (30 days following the prescription). Time 30 days prior to the first prescription was
removed to account for possible contra-indications. Cases of upper GI bleeding were identified on
the basis of the occurrence of ICD-9 diagnosis codes in the problem list. These codes pertain to
esophageal, gastric, duodenal, peptic, and gastrojejunal ulceration, perforation, and hemorrhage,
as well as gastritis and non-specific gastrointestinal hemorrhage. For more information on this set
see Schuemie et al (2014).
