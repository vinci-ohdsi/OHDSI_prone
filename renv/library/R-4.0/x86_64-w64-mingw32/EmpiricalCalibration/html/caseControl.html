<h2>Odds ratios from a case-control design</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Odds ratios from a case-control design
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
data(caseControl)
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 47 rows and 4 variables: </p>
 <dl>
<dt>drugName</dt><dd><p>Name of the drug</p>
</dd>
<dt>groundTruth</dt><dd><p>Whether the drug is a positive (1) or negative (0) control</p>
</dd> <dt>logRr</dt><dd><p>The log
of the incidence rate ratio</p>
</dd> <dt>seLogRr</dt><dd><p>The standard error of the log of the incidence rate
ratio</p>
</dd> </dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the odds ratios (and standard errors) produced using a case-control design.
The outcome is upper GI bleeding, the drug of interest (groundTruth = 1) is sertraline. Also
included are 46 negative control drugs, for which we believe there to be no causal relation with
upper GI bleeding. We used a database of medical records from general practices in the USA, the
General Electric (GE) Centricity database, which contains data on 11.2 million subjects. We
restricted on study period (start of 1990 through November 2003), age requirements (18 years or
older), available time prior to event (180 days), number of controls per case (6), and risk
definition window (30 days following the prescription). Controls were matched on age and sex. Cases
of upper GI bleeding were identified on the basis of the occurrence of ICD-9 diagnosis codes in the
problem list. These codes pertain to esophageal, gastric, duodenal, peptic, and gastrojejunal
ulceration, perforation, and hemorrhage, as well as gastritis and non-specific gastrointestinal
hemorrhage. For more information on this set see Schuemie et al (2014).
